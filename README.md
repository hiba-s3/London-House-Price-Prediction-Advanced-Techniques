##  Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical features  
   - Scaling numerical values  

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extracting useful features (year, month, etc.)  
   - Creating interaction features  
   - Dimensionality reduction  

3. **Modeling**
   - Baseline models: Linear Regression, RandomForest  
   - Advanced models: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
   - Ensemble stacking for best performance  

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
   - Cross-validation for robust results  

5. **Submission**
   - Final predictions exported as CSV  
   - Submitted to Kaggle for leaderboard evaluation
